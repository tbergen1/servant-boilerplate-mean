# Servant Boilerplate: MEAN Stack

A Servant Boilerplate Application already integrated with [Servant](https://www.servant.co) built on the MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node) stack.  Use this to rapidly build Servant applications by starting with this boilerplate application.  It's what we use! â€“  The Servant Team

## Features:

* **Lean MEAN Stack:** There is very little bloat in this version of the MEAN stack.
* **User Management:** User Authentication via Servant is already built and ready to use.  Authentication libraries like Passport are not needed!

* **Database:** A MongoDB database is set-up and user records are stored automatically when a user connects their servants.
* **Webhooks:** Webhook integration is already set up.  Every time content is created/edited/destroyed on a Servant connected to this app, this app is notified.
